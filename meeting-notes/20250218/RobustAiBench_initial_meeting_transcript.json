itself around something that can't be corrupted like so easily as these.","startTime":"14:13","endTime":"14:24","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And let's remember that the test benchmark data sets at the beginning of machine learning they were super helpful for everyone to have the same open test data set because we could reproduce it.","startTime":"14:24","endTime":"14:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We can compare different machine learning algorithms for training and see which one's the best and then everyone repeats it.","startTime":"14:39","endTime":"14:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But now that we're in the age of deep learning where you can't reproduce the training.","startTime":"14:45","endTime":"14:50","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can't check that they didn't include the test data.","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"14:53","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is really the wrong way of evaluating models and yeah, we need to change it.","startTime":"14:54","endTime":"14:59","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What we're building likely will be more difficult, but I mean there's enough money in AI to fix this.","startTime":"14:59","endTime":"15:05","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"15:05","endTime":"15:06","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's my perspective on it.","startTime":"15:06","endTime":"15:08","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And just open for anyone to chime in, how do you guys see the problem of AI evaluation?","startTime":"15:08","endTime":"15:20","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Hi.","startTime":"15:24","endTime":"15:24","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Basically what you're saying is people are just throwing numbers out there that aren't being evaluated correctly.","startTime":"15:24","endTime":"15:29","speaker_name":"Saif Mir","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:29","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"And the purpose of this is to achieve proper evaluation rather than just attributing false numbers to things we don't know.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:37","speaker_name":"Saif Mir","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, we just don't know if people are cheating.","startTime":"15:37","endTime":"15:41","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm convinced that everyone is cheating.","startTime":"15:41","endTime":"15:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm convinced.","startTime":"15:43","endTime":"15:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we have, there's existing cases where it's come out for the public data sets like human eval.","startTime":"15:43","endTime":"15:52","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's very like, it wouldn't be surprising to anyone, but there are some people who put effort into, like ARC AGI, they put effort into having a private data set and testing people.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But then scandals come out showing that OpenAI somehow corrupted them and got access to that, to the results so that they could fine tune it.","startTime":"16:03","endTime":"16:11","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:13","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's definitely a problem.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:16","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, there's probably even cases where they've cheated and not known, you know, just scraping the Internet for data, you're bound to get some of the questions and answers.","startTime":"16:16","endTime":"16:32","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's definitely true.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:36","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For large language models.","startTime":"16:36","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's very true.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I mean, I suppose also for language models, for translation and those things, you have a similar problem that things just get sucked in.","startTime":"16:39","endTime":"16:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"If I may add, this is definitely true and we actually have some evidence.","startTime":"16:51","endTime":"16:56","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So for example, I'll tell you a story of how Facebook, I guess somebody said like somebody's from Facebook.","startTime":"16:57","endTime":"17:03","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So if you haven't heard this, you can take it from me.","startTime":"17:03","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But basically Meta released a model, a translation model called the no Language Left behind, the NLLB model.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And in it they showed for the first time using a single model, they can translate between 200 languages and so on.","startTime":"17:15","endTime":"17:21","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Which is a great kind of like engineering effort, to be honest.","startTime":"17:22","endTime":"17:24","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But my concern was really on the evaluation, many of the language they covered were languages from Africa, like language we've been working on.","startTime":"17:24","endTime":"17:34","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And what they did is basically we saw instances like Lisan, for example, developed an open benchmark data set for researchers for anyone to build their models and check their results on.","startTime":"17:34","endTime":"17:49","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But they kind of put it as a training data and they don't mention this in their paper.","startTime":"17:49","endTime":"17:55","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"They don't mention it anywhere.","startTime":"17:55","endTime":"17:57","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But if you dig on their GitHub repo you would find that some of the data sets, as Jason mentioned, because they just simply say like we scrape the web, you see like pointers, links to this kind of data sets, these benchmarks really included in them.","startTime":"17:57","endTime":"18:13","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So I think there's no doubt that many of this large language models or other like big single models, whether it's translation models or speech recognition models, are including this benchmark data set.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So it's a real problem.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:28","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So I just wanted to you know, give one instance of a concrete example of where it happened.","startTime":"18:29","endTime":"18:35","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So I guess like one of the main problems, I'm not a machine learning expert, but I guess one of the main problems is like how to come up reliably with fresh benchmarking material every time now and again.","startTime":"18:36","endTime":"18:48","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"18:49","endTime":"18:49","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Sure it's an expensive thing to do, but again we have money out there.","startTime":"18:51","endTime":"18:56","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think Duna Bench had a particular like trying to address that problem.","startTime":"18:56","endTime":"19:01","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think the problem we want to address is the corruptability of the data generation.","startTime":"19:01","endTime":"19:06","speaker_name":"Ruben

big.","startTime":"19:09","endTime":"19:11","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So scale AI is one of them.","startTime":"19:11","endTime":"19:12","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They have 5,000 employees.","startTime":"19:13","endTime":"19:14","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"so in certain areas it's an issue to get the right kind of data to test on.","startTime":"19:15","endTime":"19:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And Dina Bench had an interesting approach where people like are actively trying to find the data that the model is bad at.","startTime":"19:23","endTime":"19:32","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, I think.","startTime":"19:33","endTime":"19:34","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And they do pretty well with that.","startTime":"19:34","endTime":"19:36","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think we.","startTime":"19:36","endTime":"19:37","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm going to say that will be solved somehow mostly with money.","startTime":"19:39","endTime":"19:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the part that like Dunabench doesn't so much solve is.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or at least it's not their goal is preventing corruptibility of.","startTime":"19:47","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that people that are pushing for scores can't corrupt them or cheat.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"19:59","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think maybe at the moment as well people are start.","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"20:04","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Or what I've seen is people have started to sort of create bodies for test data.","startTime":"20:04","endTime":"20:10","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So almost big organizations that are potentially quite famous in the world being like we have a closed test set and we won't share it with anyone and you can bring your model to us and we can test it for you and we can give it a score.","startTime":"20:11","endTime":"20:26","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But at the moment that's very obviously centralized because we have to trust this big organization.","startTime":"20:26","endTime":"20:32","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And a lot of the time they're like somewhat international, not international, sorry, national organizations.","startTime":"20:32","endTime":"20:40","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then you have the big thing of why would my country test your international organization and why would his country test against Yours.","startTime":"20:40","endTime":"20:50","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you've got like a weird.","startTime":"20:50","endTime":"20:52","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Everyone's got their own test sets that are hidden and no one's trusting it, basically.","startTime":"20:53","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I think if you can bring everyone together in some sort of blockchain, decentralized system.","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:07","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, maybe we would actually do it.","startTime":"21:08","endTime":"21:11","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That could bring all these things together and actually create like an internationally trusted system for testing these data sets, which I think is a big thing that's missing at the moment.","startTime":"21:12","endTime":"21:22","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I like that you have the perspective where nationalities are involved.","startTime":"21:22","endTime":"21:26","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Robert, working on Space DAO has to deal with the US Space Force because US Space Force controls what American space satellite companies are allowed to do.","startTime":"21:27","endTime":"21:37","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And let me.","startTime":"21:38","endTime":"21:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I guess other examples of companies that do private testing, ARC AGI is one of them.","startTime":"21:39","endTime":"21:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Seal, I think, is the.","startTime":"21:45","endTime":"21:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So SEAL by Scale AI, I think is the best that I found.","startTime":"21:47","endTime":"21:52","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I do think that keeping the test data set private is part of the solution.","startTime":"21:53","endTime":"21:58","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because if it's private, you can't retrain on it, you can't test on it.","startTime":"21:59","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But indeed, this involves trust.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:06","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you have to trust Scale AI that they don't make a deal with one of the companies to get their scores up.","startTime":"22:06","endTime":"22:13","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not only that, with seal, they don't publish the test results, which of course makes it easier for them because it allows.","startTime":"22:13","endTime":"22:20","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It means that they can reuse test data.","startTime":"22:20","endTime":"22:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if, like, one of the companies can figure out who.","startTime":"22:25","endTime":"22:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Which of the prompts are coming from whom, they can also learn that test data.","startTime":"22:30","endTime":"22:35","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I guess this goes to one of the big design decisions.","startTime":"22:35","endTime":"22:40","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, is it.","startTime":"22:42","endTime":"22:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is it important to, like, I think we should kind of have all of it.","startTime":"22:43","endTime":"22:48","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We should have.","startTime":"22:48","endTime":"22:48","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's private data, and that data then must get published later.","startTime":"22:48","endTime":"22:55","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that data does not get reused.","startTime":"22:55","endTime":"22:57","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you don't only have one entity making the data, but multiple, such that if you have seal, hopefully we can convince Scale to participate, then they are one of the people providing results.","startTime":"22:57","endTime":"23:10","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But there's n others.","startTime":"23:11","endTime":"23:12","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if your model has a much better score with seal, it'll be visible.","startTime":"23:12","endTime":"23:19","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Most likely you corrupted seal and then, you know, the whole point of corruption would be pointless because people would see it.","startTime":"23:20","endTime":"23:26","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, private data, I think is a part of it.","startTime":"23:28","endTime":"23:32","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Getting it all together, I think is second part.","startTime":"23:32","endTime":"23:35","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I agree with you.","startTime":"23:35","endTime":"23:36","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"23:41","endTime":"23:42","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Another question is, like, when you say that you can give your model to another company to evaluate on their data set, is there any, like, reverse issue with trusting that, like, they can maybe reverse engineer parts of your model?","startTime":"23:42","endTime":"23:56","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I mean, I know that there's this model learning type of stuff.","startTime":"23:56","endTime":"23:59","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Is that also something you want to consider?","startTime":"24:00","endTime":"24:02","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"It's a good point.","startTime":"24:02","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I had not thought too much about it.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:05","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of course, this was a big complaint of OpenAI.","startTime":"24:05","endTime":"24:08","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think that as soon as you publish the model, you basically can't prevent this because anyone can become an open, a customer of OpenAI.","startTime":"24:08","endTime":"24:20","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so they kind of can't prevent someone from distilling knowledge out of their model.","startTime":"24:20","endTime":"24:28","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The only types of people that can prevent it are those that sell their AIs, like B2B and maybe they're not applicable for us.","startTime":"24:28","endTime":"24:40","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, if your model is so secret that you would not let like several independent entities test it, then maybe it's not the best use case.","startTime":"24:40","endTime":"24:53","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But maybe in the worst case it could be like an entity that's really afraid of their model getting leaked could choose like the top three benchmarkers in our system that are the highest reputation.","startTime":"24:53","endTime":"25:07","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So they could theoretically do that.","startTime":"25:09","endTime":"25:11","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, it is, I think it is a concern for some people.","startTime":"25:12","endTime":"25:14","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think that you're probably.","startTime":"25:18","endTime":"25:21","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There is a use case for even models that need to remain secret.","startTime":"25:25","endTime":"25:31","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You could, you know, publish the results by blockchain address so that, you know, nobody knows precisely who each blockchain address is until you verify it with a private key.","startTime":"25:33","endTime":"25:50","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So, I mean, there's lots of opportunity, I think, for companies to show that our model performs well against these other mainstream models and not have to publish that their model, you know, exists, you know, by name.","startTime":"25:52","endTime":"26:18","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I think there's a lot of opportunity there as well, because as of right now, none of those leaderboards contain the private models.","startTime":"26:19","endTime":"26:32","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so there's no real way for people to check and see if I'm evaluating this private model, how do I know how it actually performs against O3 many or something like that.","startTime":"26:34","endTime":"26:52","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That is an interesting point.","startTime":"26:52","endTime":"26:53","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I guess the way that a private B2B company could do this would be that they get tested and the test results are verified, and then when they go sell it to their customers, they can reveal only to their customers that this is them.","startTime":"26:53","endTime":"27:14","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or even more sexy if there's a ZK proof.","startTime":"27:14","endTime":"27:17","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I guess their customers, they would trust them that they have this certificate, but the public doesn't know who it was that was tested there.","startTime":"27:18","endTime":"27:28","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"27:28","endTime":"27:28","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"27:29","endTime":"27:30","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What I would be dreaming about, I'm not sure if that can happen, but what I would be dreaming about, of course, is that you don't have to put your whole model on shame, but rather maybe like a commitment to it so that you're kind of committed to having to evaluate it in this way and then using snarks or something.","startTime":"27:31","endTime":"27:47","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But it might be prohibitively expensive of course.","startTime":"27:47","endTime":"27:50","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But I mean that would kind of be nice if you don't have like, have to have public access in order for this to run.","startTime":"27:50","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But then like a question is whether we can find some multi party computation way to make it so that the testing doesn't have to have the full access.","startTime":"27:57","endTime":"28:07","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I'm not sure.","startTime":"28:08","endTime":"28:09","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think we should investigate with the people that are currently getting evaluated whether or not how much they care.","startTime":"28:10","endTime":"28:18","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So of course all the companies that have public access to their model, like open AI and so on, they already have it so they're not worried about it.","startTime":"28:18","endTime":"28:27","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, let's investigate.","startTime":"28:29","endTime":"28:31","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's also quickly.","startTime":"28:31","endTime":"28:33","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, maybe we can jump into some of the architectural discussions and I intentionally didn't want to like present the architecture that had in mind, but maybe it's time to get a little bit into that.","startTime":"28:33","endTime":"28:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think most of you have already heard the design that I had in mind.","startTime":"28:45","endTime":"28:49","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But Stella, since you mentioned putting the model on chain, like that would be a different direction than I was thinking about going, my thought was that we have n validators that were benchmarkers.","startTime":"28:49","endTime":"29:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So one of them could be Scale Seal, another one could be ML Commons, another one could be, you know, in the case of let's take machine translation as an example because we have representatives.","startTime":"29:03","endTime":"29:16","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So another one could be actually one of the AI companies like Lasan being a validator.","startTime":"29:16","endTime":"29:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now it'll be super obvious that Lasan would be biased towards themselves.","startTime":"29:23","endTime":"29:27","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if the benchmarkers identify themselves, this is something that can easily be taken out by user who wants to get this number out.","startTime":"29:27","endTime":"29:35","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we have n benchmarkers.","startTime":"29:35","endTime":"29:37","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Each of them are creating their own test data and this is off chain, but they need to register somewhere.","startTime":"29:37","endTime":"29:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of course they need to tell the world like I am validating this task and let's say the task is just text to text, machine translation, English to.","startTime":"29:43","endTime":"29:53","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then on the other side there are startups that all have models and probably like one of us from the foundation would run Google Translate and Microsoft Translate so that it's easy to compare.","startTime":"29:54","endTime":"30:08","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then the, each of the benchmarkers live query the old models that have registered to this challenge and only once you are releasing the scores would you put those on chain or somewhere.","startTime":"30:09","endTime":"30:24","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And like the signing, the most important, the part where you absolutely have to sign things is signatures on the side of the validators sending the prompts and the Machine learning startups responding to it and then getting that response back, evaluating it and then signing again.","startTime":"30:25","endTime":"30:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The score that you gave for this one translation, often it's blue score, but it could be anything.","startTime":"30:47","endTime":"30:53","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Having those all signed and then you need to just publish these signatures.","startTime":"30:54","endTime":"30:58","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Putting it on a blockchain would make it canonical and widely available and completely decentralized.","startTime":"30:58","endTime":"31:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I see all the benefits.","startTime":"31:03","endTime":"31:05","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But theoretically once these things are signed, you can put them on GitHub or IPFS or BitTorrent anywhere you have.","startTime":"31:05","endTime":"31:16","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"As long as people can verify the signatures of the scores afterwards.","startTime":"31:16","endTime":"31:20","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"31:22","endTime":"31:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So on a super high level, I don't know, did anyone else have like high level, completely different ideas on how to do this?","startTime":"31:23","endTime":"31:31","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I've got a quick question of what you're explaining.","startTime":"31:39","endTime":"31:42","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the validators or the test set providers, are they trusted entities in all of this or are they meant to be untrust or not required to have trust?","startTime":"31:42","endTime":"31:56","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's a good question.","startTime":"31:56","endTime":"31:57","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if I were to build a this in a blockchain way then of course it would be permissionless.","startTime":"31:57","endTime":"32:04","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I think realistically it makes sense that there, these are trusted entities so we have less trust because we have verifiability.","startTime":"32:05","endTime":"32:16","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you don't need to complete, like you said, you don't need to completely trust the U.S.","startTime":"32:16","endTime":"32:21","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"space Force or whoever is doing the evaluation because we create audit logs that anyone can look at afterwards having this in the framework.","startTime":"32:21","endTime":"32:30","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Anyone can see the scores, anyone can verify the scores, anyone can verify that the same prompt has not been reused.","startTime":"32:30","endTime":"32:38","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Those are all like that establishes authority with the benchmarkers.","startTime":"32:40","endTime":"32:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So basically I would say yeah, probably the need and authority in a realistic case, in a full blockchain case, we could force them, we could force the AI model providers to be agnostic to who is the person testing.","startTime":"32:47","endTime":"33:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But like that would be the problem if in a non blockchain world, why would, let's take lasagna.","startTime":"33:05","endTime":"33:13","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Why would Lasan want to give open access to their model?","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:17","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because obviously you need to enable the API for the benchmarker from benchmarker that they've never heard of.","startTime":"33:17","endTime":"33:25","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe it's indeed their competitor or.","startTime":"33:25","endTime":"33:27","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so I'm kind of leaning towards like permissionless, but a whole framework for establishing the trust in the scores that you're giving out.","startTime":"33:29","endTime":"33:40","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But super open for other things.","startTime":"33:41","endTime":"33:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, thank you for sharing your way of like maybe approaching this problem in one way.","startTime":"33:47","endTime":"33:54","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I think as you suggested at the beginning, I clearly see two things going on.","startTime":"33:54","endTime":"33:58","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I think one is maybe that we should discuss like theoretical kind of without even getting bogged down with the details of like, which are, you know, we can abstract away like as you came.","startTime":"33:58","endTime":"34:09","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"What are the attributes of like the testers?","startTime":"34:09","endTime":"34:11","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"What are the attributes of like the different, you know, service providers and then what are the requirements we need for the data set to kind of like then have, you know, one approach, for example that hopefully we can prototype on.","startTime":"34:12","endTime":"34:27","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And yeah, typically I'm thinking of like the core problem here is, you know, static data sets can be gained.","startTime":"34:27","endTime":"34:37","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So we need to make sure that whatever we're working on should be dynamic.","startTime":"34:37","endTime":"34:41","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I think centralized is something that is the problem again that we're saying like from trust issue.","startTime":"34:42","endTime":"34:48","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"National.","startTime":"34:48","endTime":"34:48","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"It was mentioned it could be national interest.","startTime":"34:49","endTime":"34:53","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"It could be from a company's perspective from the providers even there could be competition from testers as well.","startTime":"34:53","endTime":"34:59","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"34:59","endTime":"34:59","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"For reputation and so on.","startTime":"34:59","endTime":"35:01","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So yeah, decentralized over centralized and then that trust issue.","startTime":"35:02","endTime":"35:06","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So I'm saying like maybe we should have like that discussion separately with like a concrete implementation.","startTime":"35:08","endTime":"35:16","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Then like maybe we can start with existing APIs on a specific kind of like ML task with a subset of like the testers to test this out in a simple prototype.","startTime":"35:16","endTime":"35:28","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Because otherwise like it would be.","startTime":"35:28","endTime":"35:30","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"It might get a bit difficult to make progress.","startTime":"35:31","endTime":"35:34","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Okay, I'm done.","startTime":"35:34","endTime":"35:36","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Thank you.","startTime":"35:36","endTime":"35:37","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I do have one question.","startTime":"35:40","endTime":"35:42","speaker_name":"Yufan Jiang","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So because you mentioned that otherwise basically the public can also verify the results and I guess or I thought that the private test data set will not be published.","startTime":"35:42","endTime":"35:51","speaker_name":"Yufan Jiang","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"35:51","endTime":"35:52","speaker_name":"Yufan Jiang","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think we.","startTime":"35:53","endTime":"35:54","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So open discussion.","startTime":"35:54","endTime":"35:56","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think that the private test data has to get published after some time period.","startTime":"35:56","endTime":"36:01","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you.","startTime":"36:02","endTime":"36:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It could be done in cohorts.","startTime":"36:03","endTime":"36:05","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think the absolute best way would be continuous.","startTime":"36:06","endTime":"36:10","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So like every day each of the benchmarkers release like one test and then like after, I don't know, 30 days, then another maybe five days for evaluation and then they publish the whole all of the results.","startTime":"36:10","endTime":"36:25","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We could say that this is optional.","startTime":"36:26","endTime":"36:28","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it would just be.","startTime":"36:29","endTime":"36:31","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That would be the best thing.","startTime":"36:31","endTime":"36:33","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And, and I'm also thinking like why not if you are truly making, if you don't make new test data sets as a private benchmarker, you're just opening yourself up to the model providers, finding out what your test data is and fine tuning towards it.","startTime":"36:33","endTime":"36:54","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Having someone off the model just like find the right answers and train them in one small other alternative mitigation I thought of is that the benchmarkers could send a lot of data, like a lot of prompts and only actually evaluate like less than 1% of those.","startTime":"36:54","endTime":"37:15","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then it would be harder to find out which of them are the test data.","startTime":"37:16","endTime":"37:20","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's.","startTime":"37:20","endTime":"37:21","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think they should get published.","startTime":"37:22","endTime":"37:24","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think that's the best way.","startTime":"37:24","endTime":"37:26","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Jason, you had another point.","startTime":"37:32","endTime":"37:34","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh yeah.","startTime":"37:36","endTime":"37:37","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"From my perspective, I think we do need an evaluation pipeline for the benchmark, an automated evaluation pipeline, if that's right.","startTime":"37:37","endTime":"37:49","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"I think for now most benchmarks don't have a very unified pipeline.","startTime":"37:50","endTime":"37:55","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"You just look into their GitHub, look at their ReadMe and do it step by step to evaluate a model.","startTime":"37:55","endTime":"38:02","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"But it is not automated.","startTime":"38:02","endTime":"38:03","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"It needs a person to look at the readme and do it step by step.","startTime":"38:04","endTime":"38:09","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"But in our case I think we need a more unified pipeline for doing the evaluation.","startTime":"38:09","endTime":"38:15","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Yeah, totally.","startTime":"38:16","endTime":"38:17","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Particularly if it's going to be happening continuously, which is what I think.","startTime":"38:17","endTime":"38:22","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well then yeah, it has to be automatic.","startTime":"38:22","endTime":"38:26","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for maybe this is much easier with evaluating AI models that coming from startups.","startTime":"38:26","endTime":"38:35","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Lasan for instance, they have an API so just evaluating, getting results is already automated on his part in contrast to I suppose human eval and some others where you do it locally.","startTime":"38:35","endTime":"38:50","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So yeah, I think inherently in the process of designing the system such that it's a live system.","startTime":"38:50","endTime":"38:56","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You like.","startTime":"38:57","endTime":"38:58","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, everyone's gonna have to be, it's gonna have to be automated and for the validators or the benchmarkers, I think it's pretty straightforward.","startTime":"38:58","endTime":"39:06","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So they have some people writing new test data, put that into a database somewhere, upload a CSV and then there's just a small process going that's slowly sending out the data, collects all the responses and they have a separate process for humans to grade each of them.","startTime":"39:06","endTime":"39:22","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"39:24","endTime":"39:24","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think on the benchmarker side it's straightforward on the person that has an AI model.","startTime":"39:24","endTime":"39:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"39:29","endTime":"39:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Has to be wrapped in an API.","startTime":"39:30","endTime":"39:32","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I guess there's another design question.","startTime":"39:32","endTime":"39:34","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How should the validators communicate with the AI model providers?","startTime":"39:34","endTime":"39:38","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"REST APIs open API spec I think is the most like it's less decentralized, still decent.","startTime":"39:38","endTime":"39:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You rely on DNS.","startTime":"39:45","endTime":"39:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's the only not decentralized part.","startTime":"39:47","endTime":"39:49","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's I think pretty decent and very industry standard.","startTime":"39:49","endTime":"39:53","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A super decentralized version would be going through like a relay network P2P like IRO or going through gossip sub, but probably just rest API calls I'm guessing.","startTime":"39:53","endTime":"40:07","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"40:09","endTime":"40:09","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"And I have another question on the validators.","startTime":"40:09","endTime":"40:12","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"I think it is a good way to involve the companies and startups like scale AI.","startTime":"40:12","endTime":"40:19","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"They can provide high quality data if they want to cooperate with us.","startTime":"40:19","endTime":"40:23","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"But I think there is another high quality data set that's from the AI conferences.","startTime":"40:24","endTime":"40:29","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"There are thousands of papers in each AI conference each year and there are a bunch of benchmark papers.","startTime":"40:29","endTime":"40:39","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"And if we can involve them as our evaluation set, I think it will be a very nice thing.","startTime":"40:39","endTime":"40:46","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"But I'm not sure how to convince the authors and the researchers to come to our platform.","startTime":"40:46","endTime":"40:52","speaker_name":"Zerui Cheng","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"That's a really great point and leads me to this piece.","startTime":"40:53","endTime":"40:57","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for.","startTime":"40:58","endTime":"41:00","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"As you guys know, I care about changing the industry.","startTime":"41:00","endTime":"41:04","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like we're going to publish papers and that's cool, but I really want to improve the way AI works and for that we need to have a movement.","startTime":"41:05","endTime":"41:13","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There needs to be a community, we need to get people involved.","startTime":"41:14","endTime":"41:17","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It can't just be us.","startTime":"41:17","endTime":"41:18","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so, yeah, part of that is academics, like you were saying.","startTime":"41:19","endTime":"41:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there are people who have salaries from universities, many people, as you're many people here who are doing the work of making test data sets because that's a contribution to science.","startTime":"41:23","endTime":"41:34","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So yeah, how to convince them to participate in this is a good.","startTime":"41:35","endTime":"41:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is a good question.","startTime":"41:39","endTime":"41:40","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"My first thought was that if we have kind of like a paper machine.","startTime":"41:40","endTime":"41:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let me.","startTime":"41:45","endTime":"41:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a good paper because every evaluating this, I think, I hope it's that one.","startTime":"41:47","endTime":"42:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, it's not this one.","startTime":"42:06","endTime":"42:08","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, I gotta go search for it again.","startTime":"42:10","endTime":"42:12","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But basically.","startTime":"42:12","endTime":"42:13","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Dinabench ML comments they produce regularly produced publications as a result.","startTime":"42:13","endTime":"42:19","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry, it's not this one.","startTime":"42:19","endTime":"42:20","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll go find it a bit after.","startTime":"42:21","endTime":"42:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But they regularly produce publications where they just show the results and some of them are super high impact because they.","startTime":"42:23","endTime":"42:34","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So in their case, they're saying they're building different test data, but it is like an interesting result if most of the industry thinks that model A is the best and then through our independent testing, model B was the best.","startTime":"42:34","endTime":"42:49","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I was kind of thinking, yeah, maybe that is just like we can help people get another paper out of it if they contributed to the testing.","startTime":"42:50","endTime":"43:00","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then there's like a regular machine in the NGO that's testing putting these papers together and publishing them.","startTime":"43:00","endTime":"43:06","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's one thought.","startTime":"43:08","endTime":"43:09","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're going to have a lot of thoughts.","startTime":"43:10","endTime":"43:11","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think I want to point out two other groups of people that are going to be interested or that we should get involved.","startTime":"43:11","endTime":"43:17","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we have one, we have academics.","startTime":"43:17","endTime":"43:20","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then the second one I think is super important is test data companies like Scale AI, We've already mentioned them.","startTime":"43:20","endTime":"43:28","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are a number of companies who it's their business to make data sets and we want them to be involved.","startTime":"43:28","endTime":"43:35","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then of course, what's this one decision to make?","startTime":"43:35","endTime":"43:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Attract people that are in the Process of releasing.","startTime":"43:39","endTime":"43:42","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, this is actually kind of related to the academic one.","startTime":"43:42","endTime":"43:46","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is also related to what you were saying.","startTime":"43:46","endTime":"43:49","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think maybe third one here is AI startups.","startTime":"43:49","endTime":"43:52","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So like how do we get AI startups to participate?","startTime":"43:53","endTime":"43:55","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm not too worried about it.","startTime":"43:56","endTime":"43:57","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If we start publishing papers and if we get the other people involved, then we will just establish ourselves as the new norm and people will follow like they have to get benchmarked by us if it's the new norm.","startTime":"43:57","endTime":"44:13","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, there could be these other considerations that we've mentioned.","startTime":"44:13","endTime":"44:18","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So privacy of B2B models could be considered.","startTime":"44:18","endTime":"44:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"44:25","endTime":"44:28","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Anyone have other points on how to like establish the movement?","startTime":"44:28","endTime":"44:33","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I think once we publish a paper that's probably the gonna have to be the opening salvo because we have to establish our credibility first.","startTime":"44:39","endTime":"44:49","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then I think the academics would probably want to get involved since, you know, their business is publishing papers.","startTime":"44:52","endTime":"45:04","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"If we can offer them the chance to publish another one, I'm sure they'll jump at it.","startTime":"45:04","endTime":"45:09","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So yeah, I do think we obviously need to publish a paper.","startTime":"45:11","endTime":"45:15","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I would say that for instance Duna Bench, they existed like as an open source framework first before publishing the paper.","startTime":"45:15","endTime":"45:26","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I have to go look at the exact like timeline.","startTime":"45:26","endTime":"45:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it was like, yeah, it was like write the code, publish the paper and then create the ngo like ML Comments like grew out of this and then got all this money from different AI startups because they need better evaluation.","startTime":"45:29","endTime":"45:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"45:45","endTime":"45:46","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Asma, what do you think AI startups care the most about to get tested by this?","startTime":"45:47","endTime":"45:55","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I can talk about that.","startTime":"45:56","endTime":"45:58","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But like maybe following up on the previous bit, the academy involving academics or getting those data sets anyway gathered is a great idea because even if we're coming up with a new approach, it has to also benchmarked against existing kind of approach.","startTime":"45:58","endTime":"46:15","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"46:16","endTime":"46:16","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And existing approach is basically these scattered data sets from maybe AI papers across different tasks and so on.","startTime":"46:16","endTime":"46:24","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I'm sure many of you know, like many papers come with data sheets for data sets.","startTime":"46:25","endTime":"46:33","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So by following those we can unify and kind of like have of, let's say what the academic benchmark data sets would tell us about existing AI systems.","startTime":"46:34","endTime":"46:46","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Now of course the hypothesis is that they're not good because all these, you know, these big companies are, you know, they're scraping the web.","startTime":"46:46","endTime":"46:54","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And by that whether I personally believe this is intentional to kind of like, you know, hype up their models, but it's just a good idea to also show why this is broken.","startTime":"46:54","endTime":"47:06","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"47:06","endTime":"47:07","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And yeah, in terms of like what would be useful from AI startups kind of perspective?","startTime":"47:08","endTime":"47:14","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I think if you're like a tiny startup like ours and you feel like you really have developed something great, but you're at a disadvantage because there is no fair kind of evaluation data set, you're up for anyone who could come up with a good benchmark because if you truly believe you have something better than, let's say Google Translate, and yet there doesn't exist ungamed kind of evaluation data set that hasn't been used by Google Translate, we would absolutely love it.","startTime":"47:15","endTime":"47:45","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And I think I can speak for many of the people building core AI models, whether it's translation, speech recognition, even large, or we call it in the African context, small language models.","startTime":"47:45","endTime":"48:00","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"This is actually one of the pain points we have, is like a fair evaluation data set that's not tampered by big tech because we definitely believe, and we have evidence that they have used all the evaluation data sets as training data.","startTime":"48:01","endTime":"48:16","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So their results are always better than anything you could build if you follow just like standard kind of benchmarks.","startTime":"48:16","endTime":"48:22","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So you're saying basically the core thesis, if we succeed at that, then they're going to love it.","startTime":"48:24","endTime":"48:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like it's already designed for smaller AI startups.","startTime":"48:30","endTime":"48:33","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Absolutely.","startTime":"48:34","endTime":"48:35","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And this is something they cannot pull off only themselves because they run into that problem.","startTime":"48:35","endTime":"48:39","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"48:39","endTime":"48:39","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Listen, kind of creates a very independent data set, even independent that we don't touch and so on.","startTime":"48:39","endTime":"48:44","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But nobody would believe it because.","startTime":"48:44","endTime":"48:46","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Because you're saying the big tech companies are doing that.","startTime":"48:46","endTime":"48:50","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Why would we believe you that you're not using part of your data like your evaluation data set as your training data set it.","startTime":"48:50","endTime":"48:56","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So for us it's actually attractive if an independent kind of organization does it this way, you know, it's fair for everyone.","startTime":"48:56","endTime":"49:04","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Jason, you had another point.","startTime":"49:08","endTime":"49:10","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"49:11","endTime":"49:12","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I just wanted to point out that it could also be a way to evaluate the questions that professional organizations create to evaluate models.","startTime":"49:12","endTime":"49:24","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because if they can submit their question, if they're a validator, for instance, then and their question performs comparatively with the ones that we're generating, they can say that their date, their test data set is good.","startTime":"49:24","endTime":"49:49","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that may be another market.","startTime":"49:50","endTime":"49:54","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So these are these academics being test data sets or these are people like scale that have, you probably have to.","startTime":"49:55","endTime":"50:00","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Start out with academics, but I think that ultimately you could convince professional organizations to be validators and submit their own questions as part of the process and then they can point to the fact that their questions performed well in comparison with the other questions.","startTime":"50:00","endTime":"50:25","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So how do you define a question performing well versus bad well.","startTime":"50:25","endTime":"50:31","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, there's several statistical tests that you could use that would evaluate how each model performed on a, on a test that would indicate whether the test is accurately predicting how well it generalizes.","startTime":"50:31","endTime":"50:58","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So you would need enough for a statistically significant sample.","startTime":"51:03","endTime":"51:06","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But, but once you have that, you could evaluate the questions themselves.","startTime":"51:06","endTime":"51:13","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"51:14","endTime":"51:15","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So in between them, which is this is where if I want to do this statistical evaluation of different portions of the data set, that's where again, I think it's important that at some point in the future the, all the test data that everyone has made and the results that these are published, so you can then do the statistics yourself.","startTime":"51:15","endTime":"51:33","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, ultimately that would be required to get trust, I think.","startTime":"51:36","endTime":"51:40","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But, but the fact that some people make their, or some companies make their living, you know, creating tests and benchmarks, it would be good for them to have a way to prove that their tests are actually comparable with the best tests out there.","startTime":"51:40","endTime":"52:05","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"52:08","endTime":"52:09","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for the companies like scale, probably the smaller ones, because scale has established itself as a leader, and the smaller ones making test data sets, showing that their test data is good and then maybe scale costs you like, I don't know, a million to have them make a data set for you and then you can establish yourself as a commercial test data set producer that costs less than this.","startTime":"52:09","endTime":"52:31","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And in this, the on chain results that are very hard to falsify, you can see that this, you're producing good test data.","startTime":"52:31","endTime":"52:38","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"52:38","endTime":"52:38","speaker_name":"Jason Orender","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I see that.","startTime":"52:38","endTime":"52:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's cool.","startTime":"52:39","endTime":"52:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I didn't think about that angle.","startTime":"52:39","endTime":"52:41","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Stella, you have another point?","startTime":"52:42","endTime":"52:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think the point that I had actually ties in very well with what Jason just said.","startTime":"52:44","endTime":"52:47","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So I'm trying to blame blockchain again because I only have one hammer.","startTime":"52:47","endTime":"52:51","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So the thing is that blockchain gives you timestamps, right?","startTime":"52:51","endTime":"52:55","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So the thing is like why is it a problem to release your test data set when you have it?","startTime":"52:55","endTime":"53:02","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"If you have to commit on the chain already to which model version or which API kind of you have to evaluate from and then you freeze.","startTime":"53:02","endTime":"53:13","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And then multiple people and in a similar marketplace fashion can publish different questions, different tests, and then maybe, you know, you run them on all of them and maybe there should be some process to bet on the chain, maybe with some kind of like committee voting on which of these questions they actually think are like viable so that nobody interjects some bullshit questions there in that place.","startTime":"53:13","endTime":"53:40","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But yeah, so if you, then, if there is a mechanism, like Jason said, where you can actually evaluate how good the questions are, then you know, you can maybe like have a similar thing as you explain the potential where you're rating both.","startTime":"53:41","endTime":"53:54","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I think an important point.","startTime":"53:56","endTime":"53:58","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry to interrupt.","startTime":"53:58","endTime":"53:59","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Just thinking about time.","startTime":"53:59","endTime":"54:01","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is a super big question is do we want to evaluate open source models or closed source models?","startTime":"54:02","endTime":"54:09","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like things that are APIs versus things that are like something you can download.","startTime":"54:09","endTime":"54:14","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because if it's an API, there's nothing we can commit on train that would prevent the API, the person that controls the closed source hosted model, that prevents them from changing it in the background.","startTime":"54:14","endTime":"54:25","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think that's an important question for us to ask.","startTime":"54:27","endTime":"54:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do we, do we want to focus on closed source or do we want to focus on open source or let's say, let's call them open weights, like downloadable.","startTime":"54:30","endTime":"54:39","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm leaning towards the closed source because I think that's where the problem is bigger.","startTime":"54:40","endTime":"54:46","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the open source, it's kind of like it can follow from that.","startTime":"54:46","endTime":"54:50","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can package an open source thing behind an API.","startTime":"54:50","endTime":"54:53","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, but it's.","startTime":"54:55","endTime":"54:56","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We, we have to ask people to see whether or not they care about this.","startTime":"54:56","endTime":"55:00","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I have people, the guys from ML Commons that I talked to, they said, they asked me the same questions like how do we know that the AI model wasn't changed behind the fact.","startTime":"55:00","endTime":"55:11","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because in Duna Bench they have this mechanism.","startTime":"55:12","endTime":"55:14","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Everything must, all the models must be uploaded to them and then they manage it in a, their own little trust execution environment.","startTime":"55:15","endTime":"55:23","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's just a question that we have to do.","startTime":"55:26","endTime":"55:28","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We have more discussion coming up.","startTime":"55:28","endTime":"55:30","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I do want to make sure that we get a little bit of organizational stuff in also though make one more point very quickly.","startTime":"55:30","endTime":"55:38","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think there's a fundamental issue potentially with wanting to have decentralized contribution to the tests, but also wanting to use just the API, which you can change.","startTime":"55:39","endTime":"55:50","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Because I think if you don't put like some commitment, some time restraints in place for having to use an old model, then what keeps you from, you know, coming up with your own things, then training your own model on it and you know, kind of waiting before you give it to other people.","startTime":"55:51","endTime":"56:07","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So like somehow you have to guarantee the novelty of the testing sets and I think that would.","startTime":"56:07","endTime":"56:13","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So the novelty of test sets we can guarantee of the models is, that's the part where it's difficult and I think committing the novelty of the test that there's no problem.","startTime":"56:13","endTime":"56:24","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You take the, each of the test prompts, hash them, put them on chain and then we can see later on that you use those.","startTime":"56:24","endTime":"56:30","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if it's decentralized, what keeps companies that have I models from training their own AI models with the data that they're coming up with themselves and then putting the tests that they put into their own models out there to test other companies?","startTime":"56:30","endTime":"56:46","speaker_name":"Stella Wohnig","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah, they can do that and I think I mentioned it as an example.","startTime":"56:46","endTime":"56:49","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like I assume that Lasan AI would put out one data set and test the other model the other companies.","startTime":"56:49","endTime":"56:54","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's why we have multiple benchmarkers, there can't just be one.","startTime":"56:55","endTime":"56:59","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's.","startTime":"56:59","endTime":"57:00","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's fundamental of that decentralization part.","startTime":"57:00","endTime":"57:02","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So three minutes left.","startTime":"57:03","endTime":"57:04","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I want to a little bit back to organizational stuff.","startTime":"57:04","endTime":"57:08","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So one question is like org structure.","startTime":"57:09","endTime":"57:12","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's writing a paper which I suppose is more informal and we just figure it out ourselves.","startTime":"57:12","endTime":"57:18","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I am interested if anyone has opinions on like how to organize the NGO kind of long term part of this.","startTime":"57:18","endTime":"57:27","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Duna Bench originally was just funded by Meta and then was donated to ML Commons.","startTime":"57:28","endTime":"57:35","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I've worked in the decentralized at any foundation and I, I kind of like their model.","startTime":"57:36","endTime":"57:40","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you make a foundation, it has a mission and then there are working groups.","startTime":"57:41","endTime":"57:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The working group puts out the gold that they have.","startTime":"57:45","endTime":"57:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I could see us making a new foundation.","startTime":"57:47","endTime":"57:51","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I could see us firstly just like write the code.","startTime":"57:52","endTime":"57:54","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Also you can look at Conda Bench.","startTime":"57:55","endTime":"57:58","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They seem to just have written the code and people just open source contribute.","startTime":"57:58","endTime":"58:02","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"58:02","endTime":"58:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's maybe.","startTime":"58:03","endTime":"58:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So option one would be there's just a paper and there's open source contributors and there's no real Org structure.","startTime":"58:04","endTime":"58:09","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Another one would be making a new foundation or consortium and then start getting NGO money into that for the long term sustainability.","startTime":"58:10","endTime":"58:17","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Another one would be to join an existing foundation like ML Commons or the Decentralized Identity Foundation.","startTime":"58:18","endTime":"58:27","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So yeah.","startTime":"58:29","endTime":"58:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Does anyone have opinions on org structures or the first option?","startTime":"58:29","endTime":"58:34","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No Org structure, let's just build.","startTime":"58:34","endTime":"58:36","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For me build and prototypes seems to be the best way to push things forwards.","startTime":"58:40","endTime":"58:46","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Even if they're terrible at the beginning.","startTime":"58:46","endTime":"58:48","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Just having something to show people is really nice.","startTime":"58:48","endTime":"58:52","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I'd maybe be more on the side of build something and then we go from there.","startTime":"58:52","endTime":"58:58","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I mean I'm academic, I don't know how to do business.","startTime":"58:58","endTime":"59:02","speaker_name":"Robert Cowlishaw","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"For sure we should build and we should just go.","startTime":"59:04","endTime":"59:07","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There should be no stopping.","startTime":"59:07","endTime":"59:09","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm just thinking that again to have a movement you need to have people involved and so being part of ML Commons would already get us direct access to the top researchers at Meta, at Google, at all the big Companies because they're already using that to test their benchmarks.","startTime":"59:09","endTime":"59:27","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"59:29","endTime":"59:29","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm kind of thinking about it from that perspective.","startTime":"59:29","endTime":"59:31","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It gives even more reputation to the project, which maybe will get more people involved.","startTime":"59:32","endTime":"59:37","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you know, at the beginning it could just be a website at a name and it just makes it sound more grand.","startTime":"59:37","endTime":"59:42","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or joining an existing one.","startTime":"59:43","endTime":"59:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"59:45","endTime":"59:45","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Code first.","startTime":"59:45","endTime":"59:46","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I agree.","startTime":"59:46","endTime":"59:46","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Code right away.","startTime":"59:46","endTime":"59:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Never stop coding.","startTime":"59:47","endTime":"59:49","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Anyone else care about Org structures?","startTime":"59:54","endTime":"59:56","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think maybe what I wanted to just agree with Robert, I guess maybe what he also wanted to mean if I'm right, is basically that we should start kind of putting a prototype of this idea and maybe also have a, you know, writing on the site just to kind of clean out theoretical kind of things that we're discussing.","startTime":"59:57","endTime":"01:00:18","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Have, you know, strip out all the jargons and have a unified way of referring to all components involved in this evaluation.","startTime":"01:00:18","endTime":"01:00:27","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And then kind of from there, if there is something substantial we can, you know, it would be clear whether, you know, we have aligned kind of organizations we want to join or this is something independent.","startTime":"01:00:27","endTime":"01:00:40","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But that's my view.","startTime":"01:00:40","endTime":"01:00:42","speaker_name":"Asmelash Teka Hadgu","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:00:42","endTime":"01:00:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"01:00:43","endTime":"01:00:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I guess I should have continued the question, which is that it kind of leads into how we work together.","startTime":"01:00:43","endTime":"01:00:48","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So like at the Descendraden foundation we had bi weekly calls and there's like a chair and organize what's going to be discussed at this point and there's like deadlines for when we need to have something decided.","startTime":"01:00:49","endTime":"01:01:03","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would say that actually the way that works and also how the Linux foundation works, it's quite slow, even though they pride themselves in being fast.","startTime":"01:01:03","endTime":"01:01:12","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we should probably start with just working on something.","startTime":"01:01:12","endTime":"01:01:16","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe then the question is more broadly like, yeah, how do we organize ourselves?","startTime":"01:01:17","endTime":"01:01:22","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Bi weekly meetings, asynchronous communication through GitHub discussions maybe like I can figure out who wants to work on what and do a bit of coordination and then make smaller groups like the people who said they want to work on development.","startTime":"01:01:23","endTime":"01:01:38","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we need to of course have interchange between development and theory.","startTime":"01:01:39","endTime":"01:01:43","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"01:01:45","endTime":"01:01:46","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How to work together.","startTime":"01:01:46","endTime":"01:01:47","speaker_name":"Ruben Wolff","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just wanted to say I think I'm on board with Azme and Robert is that I think if we build something we'll have a far stronger idea of what our tangible goal is.","startTime":"01:01:51","endTime":"01:02:00","speaker_name":"Saif
